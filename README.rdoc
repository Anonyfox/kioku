= kioku

A handy little Ruby Gem for a very leightweight NoSQL data storage solution. In fact, it is simply a key-value-store in a single file. The name of this gem is equivalent to the japanese word for storage ;)

== Advantages of kioku: 
* extremly lightweight, no need for configurations
* blazing fast for small to mid-size datasets
* pure Ruby implementation, no native extensions neccessary
* let you store in your data in the human-readable YAML format

== When NOT to use kioku
* big amount of data
* write-intensive applications

== Contributing to kioku
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
